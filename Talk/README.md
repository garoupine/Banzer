<h1>Disclaimer</h1>

I would like to clarify that  I am by no means a professional programmer,I pursue programming as a hobby(I cant properly name variables, I keep wanting to call them things like 'foos', 'bars', and 'whatever'!). Therefore, please keep in mind that the code that I provide is based on my personal knowledge and experience, and may not follow best practices or optimal coding techniques.I strongly advise that you use my code with caution and encourage you to use it only as a reference or starting point for your own code.Your attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.

This Model is still in development 
The architecture is random.
This file is not a real Readme file rather a to do list(Dnt mind me!)



## record.py : 
+ <s>fuction take "path" as argument where to store the data (at least for now)</s>  
+ the wave command is stored ine the same directory.to be changes ASAP

## model.py :
+ <s>save and load the api still missing</s> 
+ The module initiation has its own methode now <u>create_module()</u>.The module can be either created by calling the previously mentioned method or loaded by means of the <u>load_module()</u> method

## utility.py :
+ maybe a fucntion to display the wave from and the respective secptogram
+ the get_command() <s>to be tuned</s> Pls just dnt call it on the recorded wave file TNX

## data.py :
+ to revisit  / the encode audio fucntion to be tuned (brute forced the path!!! Fix it pls)

## tour.ipynb : 
+ Hash the debug output (No cuda!) 

## main.py : 
+ still missing XXXXXXXXXXX  

### all : 
+ all the hard coded paths and variables should be exported to the config file.
+ fuction to export all the configuration
+ function to open the config file and get all the parameters (half implemented)
+ set_seed() the seed is hard coded for now,should be imported form the config file .
+ save and load the module fucntions path hard coded for now. to be exported to the config file.
+ The Bnazer project Readme.md file got out of controle.Need to keep the most important stuff and migrate the rest (ps4 controller setup to its own readme file)
+ Mention the data set (link + license)
+ more data to train the thing

+ If u read that far tnx for ur time and i hope u got smth out of all that nonsense. Have fun with the module!
